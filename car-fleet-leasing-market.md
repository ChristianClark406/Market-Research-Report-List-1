<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Fleet Leasing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Close End Lease</li><li>Open End Lease</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the car fleet leasing market, there are two main types of leases: close-end and open-end leases. A close-end lease, often referred to as a "walk-away lease," allows lessees to return the vehicle at the end of the term without incurring additional charges, provided the vehicle is within agreed mileage limits and in good condition. In contrast, an open-end lease involves the lessee assuming the residual risk, meaning they may owe additional fees if the vehicle's value at lease-end is lower than anticipated.</p></p>
