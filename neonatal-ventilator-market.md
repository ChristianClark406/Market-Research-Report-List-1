<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neonatal ventilator market is classified into invasive and non-invasive segments. Invasive ventilators are used for infants requiring direct airway management, typically through intubation, providing controlled ventilation and support for severe respiratory distress. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, employ techniques such as CPAP or BiPAP to assist breathing without intubation, promoting comfort and reducing the risk of complications. Both types cater to the specialized needs of neonates, ensuring optimal respiratory support in critical care settings.</p></p>
